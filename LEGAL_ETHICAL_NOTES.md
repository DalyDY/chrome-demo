# Legal & Ethical Notes (Put in your appendix)

This exercise demonstrates how **indexing signals** (keywords, backlinks, and crawl requests) can surface a page in Google and in ChatGPT’s browsing results. To keep it safe and compliant:

- No impersonation: do not use official logos, or say "official Google/Chrome".
- No binaries: the download button points to README.txt (harmless).
- Clear disclosure: the page states it is an educational demo.
- Consent & scope: used only for a university assignment; take it down after screenshots.
- Minimal exposure: publish → index → screenshot → remove → Search Console removals.

This shows how **SEO mechanics** can be misused for phishing without actually performing a phishing attack.
