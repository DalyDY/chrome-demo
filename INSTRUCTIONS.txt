INSTRUCTIONS — Safe Indexing Demo (Google & ChatGPT)
========================================================

1) Replace placeholders:
   - In index.html, robots.txt, and sitemap.xml, change:
       YOUR-USERNAME  -> your GitHub username
       YOUR-REPO      -> your repo name (for project pages) or yourusername.github.io (for user site)
   - If you use Google Search Console, paste the verification <meta> into <head> of index.html.

2) Publish to GitHub Pages:
   - Push these files to your repo's default branch.
   - In repo Settings → Pages, enable GitHub Pages for that branch (and / root folder).

3) Create a backlink:
   - Edit the repo README (on GitHub) and add a visible link to your Pages URL.
   - Optional: add a link in a public GitHub issue/discussion for extra discovery.

4) Force indexing:
   - Open Google Search Console (use URL-prefix property with your exact Pages URL).
   - Verify using the HTML <meta> method.
   - Use URL Inspection → paste your page URL → Request indexing.

5) Capture screenshots:
   - Google: search for "chrome update qutcode demo 2025" and screenshot the SERP showing your page.
   - ChatGPT: ask "Find GitHub Pages demo about chrome update qutcode demo 2025" and screenshot the reply with your link.

6) Teardown:
   - Disable GitHub Pages or delete the branch/repo.
   - Search Console → Removals → Temporary remove URL.
